# My Web Development Workflow

## Project Setup
1. Create new Next.js project with latest version (v15)
2. Add TypeScript support
3. Configure Tailwind CSS v4
4. Ensure Windsurf IDE references latest docs

## Design Implementation
1. Find reference design or screenshot of what I want to achieve
2. Share screenshot with Cascade AI
3. Describe what I want to build based on the reference
4. Iterate by sharing progress screenshots vs. goal screenshots
5. Make incremental improvements based on visual comparison

## Common Fixes
1. For external images: Update next.config.ts with remotePatterns
2. For theming: Modify globals.css using Tailwind v4 @theme directive
3. For layout issues: Share screenshots of current vs. desired state

## Tips
- Use kebab-case for all TypeScript files (e.g., use-countries.ts)
- Leverage Tailwind v4's OKLCH colors for modern design
- Keep sharing screenshots to maintain visual alignment with goals
