​The recent nationwide protests by U.S. Postal Service (USPS) workers highlight deep concerns over the Trump administration's proposed privatization of this vital public institution. In over 150 cities, postal employees and advocates have voiced fears that such a move could lead to higher prices, reduced services, and significant job losses, particularly impacting rural communities that heavily rely on consistent mail delivery. ​
The USPS has historically played a crucial role in fostering economic stability, especially within marginalized communities. Notably, it has been instrumental in building the Black middle class by providing stable employment opportunities with benefits often unavailable elsewhere. With Black workers comprising 29% of the USPS workforce, privatization threatens to dismantle decades of progress toward job equity and financial security for these employees. ​
