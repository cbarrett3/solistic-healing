Sound healing harnesses the profound physiological effects of acoustic vibrations on our neurological and cellular systems. Research demonstrates that specific sound frequencies can entrain brainwave patterns, shifting consciousness from alert beta states to more therapeutic alpha and theta rhythms associated with deep relaxation and healing. Beyond these neurological effects, the vibrational properties of instruments like singing bowls and tuning forks appear to influence cellular structures and tissue resonance, potentially facilitating physiological repair processes at the most fundamental levels.
