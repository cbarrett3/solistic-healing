## FAQ

### About Ketamine

#### What is ketamine?
Ketamine is a medication originally developed as an anesthetic and analgesic. Classified as a dissociative anesthetic, it has been safely used in surgical settings since FDA approval in 1970. In recent years, ketamine has shown remarkable effectiveness as an off-label treatment for various mental health conditions including treatment-resistant depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, OCD, and substance dependencies.

At the neurobiological level, ketamine blocks NMDA receptors (which respond to glutamate) and has been shown to stimulate neuronal growth, synaptogenesis, and neuroplasticity—all crucial factors in mental health treatment.

#### How does ketamine work therapeutically?
Ketamine creates a temporary break from ordinary thinking patterns, allowing for a more relaxed mental state with reduced negative thought loops. This increased cognitive flexibility enables deeper processing of thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and memories that might otherwise be difficult to access.

Many clients report that ketamine helps retrain the mind to become more relaxed, creative, and self-compassionate. The neuroplasticity effects appear to support positive cognitive and behavioral changes, especially when combined with skilled therapeutic guidance during and after sessions.

### About Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy

#### What is Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy?
KAP combines ketamine administration with professional psychotherapy in a structured, supportive environment. Unlike standalone ketamine infusions, KAP integrates preparation, medicine sessions, and integration work to maximize therapeutic benefits.

The ketamine experience often creates a non-ordinary state of consciousness that can facilitate profound insights and transpersonal experiences. These experiences have been shown to expand one's sense of self and understanding of existence, potentially enabling access to your own inner healing intelligence.

Your therapist serves as a skilled guide throughout this process, helping you prepare for the experience, providing support during sessions, and assisting in processing and integrating insights afterward.

#### What is integration and why is it important?
Integration is the process of making meaning from your ketamine experience and implementing insights into daily life. It's often considered the most crucial component of psychedelic therapy, as it transforms temporary insights into lasting positive changes.

Effective integration might include:
- Journaling about your experience
- Meditation and mindfulness practices
- Time in nature
- Creative expression through art or music
- Regular follow-up therapy sessions

The healing process typically unfolds gradually over days, weeks, and months following treatment. Sometimes, important realizations emerge later through dreams, spontaneous insights, or reflection.

#### How many sessions will I need?
Treatment length varies based on individual needs, goals, and response to therapy. Most clients benefit from 3-6 ketamine sessions, while some may continue with ongoing treatment over months or years.

Each person's healing journey is unique, and we'll work together to determine the optimal treatment plan for your specific situation.

### About Psychedelic Somatic Interactional Psychotherapy

#### What is PSIP and how does it differ from other approaches?
PSIP is a body-centered approach that treats trauma by working directly with the nervous system, relationships, and traumatic memory. It synthesizes mindfulness, neuroscience, somatic therapy, and psychedelic medicine to create a comprehensive healing model.

Unlike traditional talk therapy or non-directive psychedelic therapy, PSIP:
1. Focuses on the personal and relational aspects of psychological functioning
2. Activates the body's natural self-correcting mechanisms
3. Establishes processing pathways that are enhanced by psychedelic medicines

The result is greater capacity to work with emotions, improved body awareness, increased agency, and a deeper ability to trust yourself and your experience.

### General Questions

#### What is the role of touch in therapy?
Some deep emotional wounds, particularly from childhood, carry a persistent sense of aloneness that verbal reassurance alone cannot heal. In these cases, therapeutic touch can help create safety for these wounds to be felt and healed.

Consent is fundamental to this process and is carefully established between client and therapist. Touch is never a requirement, and you're encouraged to express any concerns or boundaries at any time.

#### What is the role of music in sessions?
Music serves as a powerful guide during ketamine sessions, helping to deepen the experience and facilitate emotional processing. Carefully selected music can help navigate different psychological territories, support emotional release, and enhance the therapeutic journey.
